        - Reduce operations can consume more disk space than the manually programmed n-ary reduction
        - Objects used as task parameters must be serializable.
        - Tasks that invoke Numpy and MKL may experience issues if a different MKL threads count is used in different tasks. This is due to the fact that MKL reuses threads in the different calls and it does not change the number of threads from one call to another. This can be also happen with other libraries implemented with OpenMP.
        - C++ Objects declared as arguments in coarse-grain tasks must be passed as object pointers in order to have proper dependency management.
        - Master as worker feature is not working for executions with persistent worker in C++.
        - Coherence and concurrent writing in parameters annotated with the "Concurrent" direction must be managed by the underlying distributed storage system.
        - Delete file calls for files used as input can produce a significant synchronization of the main code.
        - Defining a parameter as OUT is only allowed for files and collections of objects with a default constructor.
