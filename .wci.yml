description: COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) is a task-based programming model which aims to ease the development of applications for distributed infrastructures, such as large High-Performance Clusters (HPC), Clouds and Container managed clusters. PyCOMPSs is the Python binding of COMPSs.<br> COMPSs provides a programming interface for the development of the applications in Python/Java/C/C++, a runtime system that exploits the inherent parallelism of applications at execution time, and a rich ecosystem for the operation monitoring, performance evaluation and integration with Jupyter/Jupyterlab. # will use GitHub repository description if not provided
