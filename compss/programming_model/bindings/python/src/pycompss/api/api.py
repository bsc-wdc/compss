PyCOMPSs API.

This file defines the public PyCOMPSs API functions.
It implements the:
    - start runtime
    - stop runtime
    - file exists
    - open file
    - delete file
    - wait on file
    - wait on directory
    - delete object
    - barrier
    - barrier group
    - snapshot
    - wait_on
    - get number of resources
    - request resources creation
    - request resources destruction
    - set wall clock
    - add logger
    - TaskGroup (class)
functions.
Also includes the redirection to the dummy API.

CAUTION: If the CONTEXT.has not been defined, it will load the dummy API
         automatically.
