 COMP SUPERSCALAR FRAMEWORK
-----------------------------

COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) is a programming model which aims to ease the development of applications for distributed infrastructures, such as Clusters, Grids and Clouds. COMP superscalar also features a runtime system that exploits the inherent parallelism of applications at execution time.

Release number 1.3
Release date: Nov-2015
-------------------------
New features:
        * Runtime:
                - Persistent workers: workers can be deployed on computing nodes and persist during all the application lifetime, reducing runtime overhead.
                  Previous implementation of workers based on a per task process is still supported.
                - Enhanced logging system
                - Interoperable communication layer: different inter-nodes communication protocol is supported by implementing the Adaptor interface (JavaGAT 
                  and NIO implementations already included)
                - Simplified cloud connectors interface
                - JClouds connector

        * Python:
                - Added constraints support
                - Enhanced methods support
                - Lists accepted as a tasks' parameter type
                - Support for user decorators

        * Tools:
                - New monitoring tool: with new views, as workload and possibility of visualizing information about previous runs
                - Enhanced Tracing mechanism

        * Simplified execution scripts

        * Simplified installation on Supercomputers

Known Limitations:
     * Exceptions raised from tasks are not handled by the master
     * Java tasks must be declared as public
     * Java objects MUST be serializable or, at least, follow the java beans model
     * Support limited to SOAP based services
     * Persistent Workers do NOT isolate task executions in a sandbox
