Next you will find information about the specific scripts for each building type

- buildpackages
    * Builds COMPSs RPM and DEB packages

- buildlocal <targetDir>
    * Builds the current trunk and installs it on a target location.
    * Needs JAVA_HOME variable to be exported on the environment.
    * If the target dir is protected you need to execute this script with root mode (remember to export the JAVA_HOME on root)

- buildMN
    * Builds the current runtime trunk locally, builds the bindings at the MN account and installs both at a target location (in MN).
