# This file describes all checks that are performed to the test trace.
#
# Entry structure:
# - Comments: Lines that start with "#"
# - To specify a family of events (type - must be million):
#      Family <Type> <Name>
# - To check specific event:
#     <Type> event <Value> #appearances
# - To check a range of events:
#     <Type> range <minValue> <maxValue> #appearances
# When a range is defined, the event 0 is defined separatedly to check
# specifically the en events.
#
# It is also supported to define "undefined" for the number of appearances for
# a range of events (e.g. RUNTIME_EVENTS). In this case, the check only
# evaluates if there is the same events as zeros.
#
# It is also possible to define the number of appearances separated with comma
# if the events can appear multiple times (e.g. THREAD_IDENTIFICATION_EVENTS)


# -------- #
# FAMILIES #
# -------- #
# A family is the Type where all events from a piece of code emits events.
# It is used to detect new events not included in the checks.
