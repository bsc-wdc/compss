# PyCOMPSs Distributed Data Set (DDS)

DDS is a lightweight library for [PyCOMPSs](https://pypi.org/project/pycompss/)
developers which contains some basic and widely used data processing methods
such as map, filter, reduce, etc. The main purpose of this library is to avoid
implementations of simple 'task' functions by developers. DDS is trustful and it
processes the data in the most adequate way in terms of parallelism.
